===== Power supply =====

The whole system runs on 3.5V
This is done by the RT8059 Buck converter
To set the output voltage, choose R2 and R3:
 - Vout= 0.6*(1+R2/R3)
 - 350 kΩ < R2+R3 < 1.75 MΩ
 - 60 kΩ < R3 < 300 kΩ
I picked R2 as 1.33 MΩ
Therefore, R3 = 275 kΩ
This could be achieved by a 250 kΩ resistor + 50 kΩ potentiometer
Then the range would be 3.28V to 3.79V


===== LEDs =====

The system uses blue LEDs with 3.2V @ 20 mA, produces 90 mcd
The maximum duty cycle is 1/6 because of refreshing
This requires 15 Ω resistor.
I picked a 12 Ω, which should increase the brightness under refreshing.
