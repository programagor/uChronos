===== Power supply =====

The whole system runs on 5.0 V
This is done by the TPS61240DRVT Buck converter
This outputs "up to 450 mA", but realistically only "up to 250 mA", circuit shon where "100 mA worked"

===== LEDs =====

The system uses blue LEDs with 3.2V @ 20 mA, produces 90 mcd
The maximum duty cycle is 1/6 because of refreshing
This requires 90 Ω resistor.
I picked a 68 Ω, which should increase the brightness under refreshing.
